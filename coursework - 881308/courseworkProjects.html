				<h2>Seat Reservation System</h2>
				<p>
					This Project was to produce a seat reservation system to a design spec, it helped me work
					on my programming development cycle skills along with skills in testing and debugging along with
					report writing skills.
				</p>

						//Creating a new speech synthesis instance with the text
						var msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("This Project was to produce a seat reservation system to a design spec, it helped me work on my programming development cycle skills along with skills in testing and debugging along with report writing skills.");
						//Saying the text inside the msg instance
						window.speechSynthesis.speak(msg);

				<h2>Computer Systems</h2>
				<p>
					We were tasked to design a circuit to take binary inputs and display a number on the counter. 
					The counter needed to display the number 1 followed by 9 to indicate the current year the 
					coursework was done. Then, this will be followed by your unique student ID number (person number).
					This task taught me a lot about boolean algebra and circuit design, also giving me the knowlegdge on
					the basics of the processor in the lectures.
